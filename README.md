#Simon Game


This repository contains the code for a simple Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges the player to remember and reproduce increasingly complex patterns of colors and sounds.


How to Play
Start the Game: Press any key to start the game.
Watch the Sequence: Observe the sequence of colors and sounds displayed.
Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the same order as the displayed sequence.
Next Level: If you correctly repeat the sequence, you will advance to the next level, where an additional step is added to the sequence.
Game Over: If you click the wrong button, the game is over, and you can restart by pressing any key.
Code Explanation
The main game logic is implemented in index.js, which includes the following key functions:


Variables
buttonColours: An array of colors used in the game (["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]).
gamePattern: An array to store the sequence of colors generated by the game.
userClickedPattern: An array to store the sequence of colors clicked by the user.
started: A boolean flag to track whether the game has started.
level: A variable to track the current level of the game.


Event Listeners
$(document).keypress(function () {...}): Starts the game on any key press if the game hasn't started yet.
$(".btn").click(function () {...}): Handles user clicks on color buttons, plays the corresponding sound, animates the button press, and checks the user's answer.



Functions
checkAnswer(currentLevel): Compares the user's clicked pattern with the game pattern. If correct, it proceeds to the next sequence; if incorrect, it plays a "wrong" sound, displays "Game Over," and resets the game.
nextSequence(): Generates the next color in the sequence, updates the level, and animates and plays the sound for the new color.
animatePress(currentColor): Adds and removes the "pressed" class to animate the button press.
playSound(name): Plays the corresponding sound for a given color.
startOver(): Resets the game variables to start over.
